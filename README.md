## Craig Smyth
My name is Craig Smyth. I am currently enrolled in the Computer Sytems Technician Diploma at Seneca College. We've covered quite a lot this past 3 semesters so as of now, I'm just enjoying learning and still figuring out what my end goal is with this diploma. Any free time I have is either spent with my girlfriend, travelling or playing video games.
